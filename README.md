# Sonic Robo Blast 2 Web Lite
The port only has version **2.2.4**, so any features or mods created for future versions will not work. 
I am not the creator of this port, so any issues you may encounter I cannot fix aside from missing necessary files.
OpenGL graphics do not work.
I mostly just removed a ton of checksums and replaced the music.dta file with a blank one and added a music.pk3 and a custom argument for it to load on start.
This will be duplicated and the duplicate will be called Super Sonic Sciences. It is more likely to get past School Spyware and Blockers.
That aside, this should load on more devices with slow networks.
